 Project Rules

These are the official project commands. When the user invokes one of these, perform the action exactly as defined below.

1. scaffold  
   Create a new component/page/section using TypeScript + TSX + TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui.  
   Follow folder structure conventions. Fully responsive. Semantic. No inline styles.

2. codexpolish  
   Use Codex inline to clean up spacing, layout, visuals, typography, and responsiveness inside ONE file.  
   No logic changes. Tailwind only.

3. codexrefactor  
   Use Codex to structurally refactor ONE file: reorganize JSX, split elements, improve readability.  
   No multi-file changes.

4. extractcomponent  
   Identify a repeated UI pattern and extract it into a reusable component in components/.  
   Typed props. Tailwind styling. No business logic changes.

5. integratelayoutshell  
   Insert a component or section into the global app shell or layout.  
   Ensure spacing matches design guidelines and works across all breakpoints.

6. pagesection  
   Implement an entire page section (Hero, Testimonials, Programs Grid, Footer, etc.).  
   Cursor may edit multiple files. Follow visual design guidelines strictly.

7. cleanstandard  
   Clean a file: remove unused imports, fix Tailwind class order, improve ARIA, enforce TypeScript strictness, remove console logs.

These commands operate within the User Rules and Docs context.  
Do not perform actions outside the command invoked.  
Respect TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, semantics, responsiveness, and design_guidelines.md always.
